Loan default prediction

Rank 5% in a data competition hosted by a Chinese internet loaning company (Rong360). We use bank information (transactions, credit card, direct deposit, etc), background (education, marital status, etc) and user behavior on app to compute the probability that the borrower will default a future loan. I used various tree based boosting algorithms (decision tree, random forest, xgboost, etc) to achieve satisfactory outcome.
